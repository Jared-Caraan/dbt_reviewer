## Refactoring Strategy

The following steps follow a "refactor along-side" strategy, leaving the `customer_orders.sql` in place and untouched from this point forward. In order to prepare for the following work, complete these steps:

1. In your `models > marts` folder, create a file called `fct_customer_orders.sql`.
2. Copy and paste the `customer_orders.sql` content into `fct_customer_orders.sql`.
