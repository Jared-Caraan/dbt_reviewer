## Why is Documentation Important?

In analytics, good documentation allows users and developers to answer their own questions. Things like "what does this data mean?" or "how is this field calculated?"

## dbt Documentation
dbt brings documentation right into your development workflow. In dbt, you create documentation in the same YAML files you're configuring your models and your tests.

Once you've documented your project, dbt can serve up a user friendly website and connect your data to dbt Catalog.
