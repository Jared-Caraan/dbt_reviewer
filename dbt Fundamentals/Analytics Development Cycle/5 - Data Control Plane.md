dbt becomes more than a modeling tool, it becomes a data control plane. dbt doesn't move the data itself, but instead it orchestrates, governs, and observes everything that does. It gives your team visibility into what's running, what's changed, and what's breaking. dbt helps manage every part of the lifecycle.

## Six Key Activities
1. **dbt Mesh (Design)**- With dbt Mesh, teams define ownership and modularize projects. It's like designing flight paths so no two planes collide.
2.  **dbt Catalog (Discover)** - Makes your model sources and documentation searchable. Like having a live map of all the flights and gates.
3.  **dbt Semantic Layer (Align)** - Define metrics once and use them everywhere. That's like ensuring all the departments use the same flight schedule and definitions.
4.  **dbt Studio, dbt Canvas, & VS Code (Build)** - developers use the dbt Studio, dbt Canvas, or VS Code Extension to write and test code. Like your hangar, your maintenance crew, your cockpit.
5.  **Scheduler & CI (Deploy)** - make sure only production-ready code takes off. No rogue flights, just tested approved deployments.
6.  **Tests & Alerts (Observe)** - With tests, alerts, and lineage tracking, dbt monitors everything in flight.
