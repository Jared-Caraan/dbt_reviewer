## Reorganizing dbt Project
1. Delete unused or unneeded folders/files.
2. Rename files according to their naming convention e.g. stg_, fct_, dim_, int_, etc.
3. Create folders according to their maturity e.g. staging, marts, etc.
4. Move your models to their respective folders.
5. For the branch name, you can prefix it by `feat/` then a brief working title.
