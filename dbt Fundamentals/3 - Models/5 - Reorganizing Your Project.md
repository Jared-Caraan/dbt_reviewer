## Reorganizing dbt Project
1. Delete unused or unneeded folders/files.
2. Rename files according to their naming convention e.g. stg_, fct_, dim_, int_, etc.
3. Create folders according to their maturity e.g. staging, marts, etc.
4. Move your models to their respective folders.

5. For the branch name, you can prefix it by `feat/` then a brief working title.
6. In dbt_project.yml, ensure that the project name in Line 5 and its corresponding value under `models:` are descriptive enough.
7. In dbt_project.yml, remove any configurations that pertains to deleted folders.
8. Staging models as a best practice should be a view.

9. Marts models are typically materialized as tables. These are frequently being queried by the BI tool.

> [!NOTE]
> The plus sign in front of the *materialization* indicates that it's a property instead of a folder

10. Split out the subfolders in *staging* connected to a specific source.
11. Split out the subfolders in *marts* to what business entity is consuming those models.

> [!NOTE]
> Snowflake will not drop a table if it's been renamed. It will just create or materialize a new table.
