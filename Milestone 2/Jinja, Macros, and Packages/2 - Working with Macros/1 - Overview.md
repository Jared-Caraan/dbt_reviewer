## Macros
- We often write similar logic in multiple places e.g. pivot, date/times, remove duplicates.
- Macros allows you to write generic logic once to be able to reuse that logic throughout your project.
- You can have multiple models use that macro in their specific use-case.
- We can use the macros that others wrote in our own work.
- Packages allow you to import macros other developers wrote into your own project.
