## Quick Refresher

**What are Data Tests?**
- **Assertions** made on models and other resources in a dbt project (e.g. sources, seeds, and snapshots).
- dbt ensures data quality through a testing framework.

**Why test?**
- Feel comfortable and confident in the code you are writing.
- Ensure your code works as expected.
- Help data consumers make data-informed decisions on accurate data.
- Build trust in the platform.
- Save time as models documented with assertions helps future you (and others) contribute to the codebase.
