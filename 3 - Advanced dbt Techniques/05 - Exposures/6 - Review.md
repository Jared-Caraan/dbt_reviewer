- By defining exposures, you create a clear lineage from your raw data to its downstream end-use cases. Defining exposures lets you:
    - Visualize the downstream resources and processes in your global lineage.
    - Run, test, and list resources that feed into your exposure.
    - Populate a dedicated page in your documentation (on the docs site and in explorer!) with context relevant to data consumers.
- Exposures are configured in `.yml` files inside of your `models/` directory.
- Once you configure an exposure, it will show up as a node in your lineage graph.
- Exposures can reference models, metrics, and sources, although we advice you not to reference sources in exposures.
- To run all nodes upstream of an exposure, use the command `dbt run --select +exposure:my_exposure_name`.
- To run all nodes upstream of all exposures, use the command `dbt run --select +exposure:*`.
- You can view exposures in the docs site after running the command `dbt docs generate`.
- You can view exposures configured in your main branch in dbt Explorer after successfully running a production job.
