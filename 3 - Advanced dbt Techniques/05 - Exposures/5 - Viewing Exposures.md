## Viewing Exposures

You can run the command `dbt docs generate`.

Inside dbt Docs, you will see Exposures on the left-hand side.

If you click one of those, you can see everything the exposure depends on. It's a really great way to see everything about your exposures all in one spot.

You can also view your exposures with dbt Explorer. Before you're able to do that though, make sure that you've already merged your changes into your main branch, and make sure that you have also successfully run a production job in your project.

You'll find the Exposures on the left-hand side.

You will also see the data freshness, validation checks, lineage, and your exposure configuration.
