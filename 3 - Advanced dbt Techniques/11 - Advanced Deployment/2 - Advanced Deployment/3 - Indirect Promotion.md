Instead of branching and merging directly to and from the main branch of the repo. An alternative is to have one or many branches in between the feature branches and our main branch and our repo. In this case, we have a branch called qa that's acting as an intermediary trunk in our repo to give us a little bit of extra time between the actual release of these feature branches for additional testing and additional QA before we update our production data platform.

In this strategy, the development life cycle might look something like this - feature branches stem from and merge into this intermediate branch called QA. Each feature branch is gonna be reviewed and validated individually, just like it is in the direct promotion life cycle. And during the standard PR process as well as any automated CI checks that we might have. The difference here is that the QA branch itself will then be deployed to the warehouse using a dbt Cloud environment and a dbt CLoud job to ensure that these groups of features together continue to run without error. Even though we might have validated that features A, B, and C individually, we're all good at that time that we merge them into the QA branch. Actually deploying the QA branch can ensure that all three of these things work in tandem with each other without any unintended consequences. Then finally on some planned deployment schedule, we're gonna merge our QA branch into our main branch here to merge all of these features into our production data platform all at once.
