## dbt Mesh

**dbt Mesh** is a really great framework that helps organizations scale their teams and data assets effectively by promoting model governance best practices and by breaking projects down into manageable sections using a multi-project structure. 

##

### Monolithic data structure vs dbt Mesh

In a monolithic project architecture, your team will interact with single dbt project. This approach is perfectly fine when the dbt project is relatively small, or when the same data team members are working to support many different functions at the same time.

However, as the project and the data team scales, your file list and DAG can look like this:

And problems can manifest in different ways.

This is when you should consider adopting dbt Mesh. dbt Mesh is a pattern that enables domain level ownership of your data assets without creating silos. This is made possible through a combination of governance and collaboration features that enable teams to ship with velocity and confidence at scale.
