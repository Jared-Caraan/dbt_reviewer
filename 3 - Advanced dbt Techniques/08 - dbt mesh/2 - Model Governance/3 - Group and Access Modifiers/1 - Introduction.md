## Introduction to Model Groups and Access Modifiers

As projects grow, the DAGs grow with them. It can be much more difficult to navigate such large monolithic projects. This can become even more challenging when you are trying to identify which model you should be using for your specific work. Groups and access modifiers can help you navigate this complexity by specifying who can reference specific models from within both centralized and decentralized project structures.

### Groups & Access Modifiers Defined

- **Groups:** Nodes that are related to one another and owned by a specific team - a way for a business to organize models based on ownership (e.g. finance, marketing, employee, data, etc.) rather than stage of development (e.g. staging, intermediate, etc.)
- **Access Modifiers:** Which **models** can access (reference) a specific model
