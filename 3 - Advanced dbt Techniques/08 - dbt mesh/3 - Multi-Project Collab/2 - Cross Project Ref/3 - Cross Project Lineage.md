## Using cross-project lineage

dbt Catalog allows us to see all the projects in the account with a cross-project lineage. We can see which projects are referencing models from another project, for example. This is beneficial for not only seeing where data is flowing, but also to see if the work that you are doing on a particular model, will impact downstream projects.

You can limit the lineage by providing a selector.
