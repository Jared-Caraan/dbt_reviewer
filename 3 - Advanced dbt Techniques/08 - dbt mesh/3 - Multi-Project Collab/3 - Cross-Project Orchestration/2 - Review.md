Triggering a job on job completion will allow you to break free of brittle time-based dependencies and break up long-running jobs into multiple parts, improving debugging and resiliency. 

To enable a job in a downstream project to trigger on completion of a job in an upstream project, toggle 'Run when another job finishes' on and select the desired job from the upstream project.
