# Analytics Development LifeCycle
## Traditional Data Teams
- Data engineers are responsible for maintaining data infrastructure and the ETL process for creating tables and views.
- Data analysts focus on querying tables and views to drive business insights for stakeholders.
## ETL and ELT
- ETL (extract transform load) is the process of creating new database objects by extracting data from multiple data sources, transforming it on a local or third party machine, and loading the transformed data into a data warehouse.
- ELT (extract load transform) is a more recent process of creating new database objects by first extracting and loading raw data into a data warehouse and then transforming that data directly in the warehouse.
- The new ELT process is made possible by the introduction of cloud-based data warehouse technologies.
## dbt
- dbt empowers data teams to leverage software engineering principles for transforming data.
- The focus of this course is to build your analytics engineering mindset and dbt skills to give you more leverage in your work.
## The Analytics Development Lifecycle (ADLC)
- Provides a structured process for building, testing, reviewing, and deploying analytics.
- Encourages iteration and collaboration so teams can confidently move from idea to production.
- Aligns data work with software engineering best practices—version control, testing, and continuous improvement.
## dbt as the Data Control Plane
- dbt orchestrates and governs the ADLC across your data ecosystem.
- It ensures consistency in how data is developed, tested, documented, and deployed.
- By serving as the “control plane,” dbt integrates with the modern data stack to enforce trust, scalability, and readiness for AI-driven use cases.
