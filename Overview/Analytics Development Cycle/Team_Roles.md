# Analytics Development Cycle
## Data Team Roles
### Data Engineer
Data engineers build systems to collect and process data. They create the foundation for all data work. Their expertise centers on building reliable pipelines.

Their role includes:

- Designing data infrastructure and architecture
- Creating and maintaining data pipelines
- Ensuring data quality and availability

Data engineers deliver value through technical solutions. They connect different data sources seamlessly. They automate data collection processes. Their work enables all downstream data activities.
### Analytics Engineer
Analytics engineering is a relatively recent data team role. Since then, the field has grown across industries. An analytics engineer is a valuable addition to a data team. 

Their role includes:

- Exploration: Exploring data already ingested into data platforms in response to stakeholder questions and needs.
- Preparation: Cleaning and preparing datasets for analytics use cases.
- Transformation: Transforming prepared datasets into objects that can serve organizational objectives, such as a super-table that can serve as a base for multiple applications.
- Documentation: Documenting the objects they find and create in the data warehouse, ensuring that other users can also see, understand, and use them.

Analytics engineering provides value in several ways:
- Having someone focused on developing and documenting data objects sets up analytics teams for data self-service with an accessible and understandable catalog of data products.
- Improved data discoverability helps prevent dark data which sits in storage unused or unknown, from dragging on storage costs and potentially becoming a compliance liability. Analytics engineers stay engaged with the data warehouse, ensuring valuable data is not overlooked.
- Analytics engineers respond to stakeholders, relieving long queues for data engineering teams and opening up time for critical maintenance, infrastructure updates, etc. It also allows for faster feedback loops since analysts with stakeholder context can work directly on maintaining and changing data pipelines.
### Data Analyst
Data analysts transform raw data into business insights. They answer questions using data analysis methods. Their focus is on solving business problems.
Data analysts serve key functions on data teams:

- Interpreting data to find trends
- Creating reports and visualizations
- Working closely with business stakeholders

Data analysts provide value through actionable insights. They help businesses make informed decisions. They translate complex findings into clear recommendations. Their analyses drive strategic business outcomes.
