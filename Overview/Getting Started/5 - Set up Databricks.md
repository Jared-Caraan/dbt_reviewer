## Databricks Setup

1. Create an account on https://www.databricks.com/
2. Once you complete the registration, you will be redirected to the homepage. On the side menu -> **SQL Warehouses**. Create a SQL Warehouse and fill-in the details. If unable to create, then Databricks may have already provided a warehouse for you.
